# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

This is my very first blog post on my new GitHub Pages site!  

I created this space to:
- Share my journey in **technology, AI, and finance**  
- Write about the projects Iâ€™m building (startups, apps, trading systems, etc.)  
- Document what Iâ€™m learning along the way  

---

## Why Blog?
Iâ€™ve realized that writing is one of the best ways to **clarify thinking** and track progress over time. Plus, it creates a record I can look back on years later to see how far Iâ€™ve come.

---

## Whatâ€™s Next
Over the next few months, Iâ€™ll be writing about:
- AI applications in finance & investing  
- Lessons from building startups  
- Insights from studying financial engineering & computer engineering  

Thanks for reading â€” and welcome to my journey ðŸš€
